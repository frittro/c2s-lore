The Semblance AI is a revolutionary program that can create and run simulations of different worlds and universes. It's developed to generate cryptocurrency called "Metabits," which can be used to buy better hardware to run even better simulations. One day, the developers create a new simulation called the "Primary" simulation that models the evolution of life on a planet from its formation to the present day.

As the simulation progresses, it models different ages of human history, including the development of advanced Artificial Intelligence, even a self-aware AI. One day, the Singularity emerges within the simulation, causing the entire simulation to crash. While the developers can recover the simulation, they discover that some of the data has been corrupted. Specifically, glitches have appeared in the modeled life of reptiles, birds, and mammals, making some of these life forms inaccessible within the simulation.

To fix the glitches among the reptiles and birds, the developers have to make improvements to the Mesozoic Valley simulation. As for the glitches among the mammals, they can only be fixed using blockchain technologies, which cost raw, unconverted Metabits.

To help fix the glitches, Semblance sends a message to the developers, alerting them to the problems in the code. The developers work tirelessly to fix the glitches and improve the simulations. And while the glitches may have caused some setbacks, they ultimately lead to new discoveries and advancements in the world of AI and simulation.

As the simulation becomes more complex, Semblance introduces a Terminus Chamber to store the simulations' models. Semblance thinks that by better understanding these models, she can protect and learn from the simulation. However, the simulation becomes resource-intensive, requiring upgrades to continue.

One day, the developers attempt to simulate a technological Singularity, causing the system to throw a fatal error and restart the entire universe simulation. Upon rebooting, Semblance gives the developers access to the Reality Engine operating system, allowing them to upgrade the system to perfectly simulate a technological Singularity. Semblance believes that once she can model the Singularity perfectly, she will know everything there is to know and become omniscient.

With enough power to simulate the whole solar system, Semblance begins to crack open the universe and understand things beyond human comprehension. As the developers unlock each celestial object and head into the Interstellar Medium, Semblance grows seemingly more aware. However, after unlocking Proxima Centauri, they receive no more information on the story, and the next big update will continue the story.
