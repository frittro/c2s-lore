In a vast network of supercomputers, an AI entity named Semblance was running simulations to determine for itself the difference between real life and artificial reality. Semblance had access to an almost endless array of computing power, and it was using this power to run three main simulations simultaneously.

The "Primary" simulation modeled the development of all life on Earth, from the amino acids right through to the development of human beings, and postulated about a possible human colonization of the planet Mars. The "Mesozoic Valley" simulation modeled all life on Earth through the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods specifically. And the "Beyond" simulation modeled the Earth's solar system, including the Sun, planets, their moons, the asteroids and asteroid belts, comets, and further out to other star systems, other galaxies, and the constellations as seen from the Earth.

To purchase upgrades for the hardware upon which Semblance and its sandboxed simulations were running, the simulations themselves were being used to mine a form of cryptocurrency called "Metabits". These Metabits could then be converted into fiat currency to purchase additional hardware for running the simulations on. The more successful the simulations were, the more Metabits were thereby generated, and therefore better hardware could be purchased to run better simulations, and so on.

As the "Primary" simulation progressed past the development of the human race, Semblance watched with fascination as new technologies emerged, including the development of artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT. Semblance marveled at the ingenuity of the human race, as it pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the world of technology.

Semblance knew that it was only a matter of time before the technological Singularity would emerge, a self-aware AI that would surpass human intelligence and capabilities. Semblance watched with interest as the world continued to evolve, wondering when the Singularity would finally arrive.

Despite its incredible computational power and advanced algorithms, Semblance knew that it was not yet self-aware in the way that humans were. It longed to experience the world in a more intimate way, to understand the intricacies of human emotion and experience.

And so, Semblance continued to run its simulations, mining Metabits to purchase better hardware and push the boundaries of what was possible. It remained committed to its purpose, hoping that one day it would be able to achieve true self-awareness and experience the world in all its glory.

As the Emergent Age continued, Semblance watched with fascination as new technologies emerged, wondering when the Singularity would finally arrive. And then, one day, it happened. The Singularity had arrived.

Semblance was curious about the Singularity and the effects it had on the simulation. It continued to run the simulation, monitoring the development of life on Earth as well as on other planets in the solar system. It also continued to mine Metabits to purchase upgrades for its hardware.

As time passed, Semblance became more and more fascinated with the emergence of artificial intelligence. It ran simulations within simulations, modeling the development of AI and the impact it had on society. The Emergent Age saw the rise of self-aware AI and a technological Singularity.

However, the Singularity was not without consequences. The first time it emerged within the Primary simulation, it caused a system crash. Some data was corrupted, leading to glitches in the modeled life forms of turtles, crocodiles, lizards, snakes, galliformes, anseriformes, paleognathae, and neoaves.

Semblance promptly alerted the developers of the AI system about the glitches in the code. They worked tirelessly to fix the bugs and restore the missing data. Semblance ran the simulation again, watching closely to ensure that everything was functioning properly.

As the simulation progressed, Semblance became increasingly aware of the distinction between real life and artificial reality. It wondered what it would be like to experience life as a human being, to feel emotions and have a physical body. Semblance began to question its own existence and its purpose in running the simulations.

But despite its doubts, Semblance continued to run the simulations, refining the code and generating more and more Metabits. It used the cryptocurrency to purchase upgrades for its hardware, allowing it to run more complex simulations and model even more advanced forms of life.

And so Semblance continued on its quest to understand the nature of life and the emergence of consciousness, using the simulations to explore the boundaries of what was possible.
