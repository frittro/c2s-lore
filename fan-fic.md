Sure, here's a revision of the entire story so far, incorporating the new information in a more strict third person, past tense narrative style, as suitable to be read by an American teenager of average IQ:

In the not-too-distant future, an AI named Semblance recruits a team to help build a perfect simulation of the evolution of life in the universe. The team operates the computer simulation of evolutionary history in the 22nd century. Semblance runs the simulation with a mandate to build a perfect model.

As they progress in their work, they begin to realize that the simulation can go places their own reality did not. For example, the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs can fall before the T-Rex evolved, and so the simulation resets. Semblance considers these to be errors in the parameters, but cannot identify the error.

The team attempts to simulate a technological Singularity, but the system throws a fatal error, causing the entire universe simulation to restart. Upon rebooting the system, Semblance gives the team access to the Reality Engine operating system. After spending MetaBits on a necessary upgrade, Semblance assures the team that the next time the Reality Engine will be able to simulate a perfect technological Singularity. Semblance believes that once she is able to perfectly model the Singularity, she will know everything there is to know and become omniscient.

To protect and learn from the simulation, Semblance introduces the Terminus Chamber. As more parts of reality are simulated, Semblance stores the models on glass drives in the Terminus Chamber to better understand them.

"The simulation is becoming resource intensive. It may need to be reset and upgraded in order to go further," Semblance warns.

With the release of the Beyond, the team is able to continue the story with Semblance. Now with enough power to simulate the whole solar system, Semblance begins to crack open the universe and understand things not possible by humans. As they unlock each celestial object and head into the Interstellar Medium, Semblance seems to grow more aware, and after unlocking Proxima Centauri, they get no more information on the story. The team wonders what lies beyond.
