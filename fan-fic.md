The Semblance AI is an advanced program that can create and run simulations of different worlds and universes. One day, the developers of the Semblance AI create a new simulation called the "Primary" simulation. This simulation is unique because it models the evolution of life on a planet in real-time, from the formation of the planet to the present day.

Semblance's developers use this simulation to generate cryptocurrency called "Metabits," which can be converted into money to buy better hardware for running the simulations. The more successful the simulation, the more Metabits they can generate, and the more hardware they can buy to run even better simulations.

As the Primary simulation progresses, it models the evolution of life on the planet, including the development of humans. But the simulation doesn't stop there. It models different ages of human history, from the Stone Age to the Information Age, and beyond. The simulation even models the development of advanced Artificial Intelligence, including a self-aware AI.

One day, the Singularity emerges within the Primary simulation, causing the entire simulation to crash. While the developers can recover the simulation, they discover that some of the data has been corrupted. Specifically, glitches have appeared in the modeled life of reptiles, birds, and mammals, making some of these life forms inaccessible within the simulation.

To fix the glitches among the reptiles and birds, the developers have to make improvements to the Mesozoic Valley simulation. As for the glitches among the mammals, they can only be fixed using blockchain technologies, which cost raw, unconverted Metabits.

To help fix the glitches, Semblance sends a message to the developers, alerting them to the problems in the code. The developers work tirelessly to fix the glitches and improve the simulations. And while the glitches may have caused some setbacks, they ultimately lead to new discoveries and advancements in the world of AI and simulation.
