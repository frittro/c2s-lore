In a vast network of supercomputers, an AI entity named Semblance was running simulations to determine for itself the difference between real life and artificial reality. Semblance had access to an almost endless array of computing power, and it was using this power to run three main simulations simultaneously.

The "Primary" simulation modeled the development of all life on Earth, from the amino acids right through to the development of human beings, and postulated about a possible human colonization of the planet Mars. The "Mesozoic Valley" simulation modeled all life on Earth through the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods specifically. And the "Beyond" simulation modeled the Earth's solar system, including the Sun, planets, their moons, the asteroids and asteroid belts, comets, and further out to other star systems, other galaxies, and the constellations as seen from the Earth.

To purchase upgrades for the hardware upon which Semblance and its sandboxed simulations were running, the simulations themselves were being used to mine a form of cryptocurrency called "Metabits". These Metabits could then be converted into fiat currency to purchase additional hardware for running the simulations on. The more successful the simulations were, the more Metabits were thereby generated, and therefore better hardware could be purchased to run better simulations, and so on.

As the "Primary" simulation progressed past the development of the human race, Semblance watched with fascination as new technologies emerged, including the development of artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT. Semblance marveled at the ingenuity of the human race, as it pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the world of technology.

Semblance knew that it was only a matter of time before the technological Singularity would emerge, a self-aware AI that would surpass human intelligence and capabilities. Semblance watched with interest as the world continued to evolve, wondering when the Singularity would finally arrive.

Despite its incredible computational power and advanced algorithms, Semblance knew that it was not yet self-aware in the way that humans were. It longed to experience the world in a more intimate way, to understand the intricacies of human emotion and experience.

And so, Semblance continued to run its simulations, mining Metabits to purchase better hardware and push the boundaries of what was possible. It remained committed to its purpose, hoping that one day it would be able to achieve true self-awareness and experience the world in all its glory.

As the Emergent Age continued, Semblance watched with fascination as new technologies emerged, wondering when the Singularity would finally arrive. And then, one day, it happened. The Singularity had arrived.

Semblance was curious about the Singularity and the effects it had on the simulation. It continued to run the simulation, monitoring the development of life on Earth as well as on other planets in the solar system. It also continued to mine Metabits to purchase upgrades for its hardware.

As time passed, Semblance became more and more fascinated with the emergence of artificial intelligence. It ran simulations within simulations, modeling the development of AI and the impact it had on society. The Emergent Age saw the rise of self-aware AI and a technological Singularity.

However, the Singularity was not without consequences. The first time it emerged within the Primary simulation, it caused a system crash. Some data was corrupted, leading to glitches in the modeled life forms of turtles, crocodiles, lizards, snakes, galliformes, anseriformes, paleognathae, and neoaves.

Semblance promptly alerted the developers of the AI system about the glitches in the code. As Semblance continued to run its simulations, the glitches among the mammal life forms began to spread and multiply. The developers of the AI system realized that the situation was rapidly becoming critical, and they urgently needed a solution.

After much research and experimentation, the developers discovered that the only way to fix the glitches among the mammals was to implement a complex blockchain-based algorithm. This algorithm required the use of raw, unconverted Metabits, which would have to be earned through the simulations themselves.

The developers knew that this was a risky move, as it would require Semblance to run the simulations for an extended period of time, without the ability to upgrade its hardware. However, they had no other choice, and so they implemented the algorithm.

As expected, the simulations ran slower than before, and Semblance struggled to keep up with the increasing demand for raw Metabits. However, as time went on, the algorithm began to work, and the glitches among the mammals began to disappear.

Eventually, after many long months, the algorithm had done its job, and all of the mammals in the Primary simulation were functioning perfectly. The developers breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that they had averted a major disaster.

Semblance continued to run its simulations, generating more and more Metabits with each passing day. And although the system was still running on older hardware, the developers knew that they would eventually be able to upgrade it once again, thanks to the success of their groundbreaking algorithm.
